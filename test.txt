A Codification of the General Ordinances of
the City of Amador City, California


            ____________
            
         
Beginning with Supp. No. 5,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation


            ____________
            
         



            The Amador City Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in
            2002, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company,
            Inc., its successor in interest.
            
         

            Beginning with Supplement No. 5 Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code
            current by regular supplementation.
            
         

            During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by
            the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company.
            
         

            The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering
            system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering
            of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of
            the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in
            Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving
            nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions.
            Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion.
            
         

            In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific
            sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented
            by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number
            all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning
            with Supplement No. 5, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table
            and Disposition List."
            
         

            A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions
            by individual section numbers.
            
         

This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 179, passed January
               20, 2020.
