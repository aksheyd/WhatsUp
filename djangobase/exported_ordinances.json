The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of this Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.\nThe chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\nChapter and Section Numbering System\nThe chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.\nPage Numbering System\nThe page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:\nEXPAND\nCHARTER CHT:1\nCHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1\nCODE CD1:1\nCODE APPENDIX CDA:1\nCODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1\nSTATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1\nCHARTER INDEX CHTi:1\nCODE INDEX CDi:1\n  Indexes\nThe indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.\nLooseleaf Supplements\nA special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nKeeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThe publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice-President, Supplement Department, and Kelly B. Cribbs, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\nThe publisher is most grateful to the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.\nCopyright\nAll editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Municipal Code Corporation and the City of Brookings, South Dakota.

The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of this Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein.\nThe chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code.\nChapter and Section Numbering System\nThe chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters.\nPage Numbering System\nThe page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:\nEXPAND\nCHARTER CHT:1\nCHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1\nCODE CD1:1\nCODE APPENDIX CDA:1\nCODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1\nSTATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1\nCHARTER INDEX CHTi:1\nCODE INDEX CDi:1\n  Indexes\nThe indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.\nLooseleaf Supplements\nA special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nKeeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThe publication of this Code was under direct supervision of Dennis Sinnett, Vice-President, Supplement Department, and Kelly B. Cribbs, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\nThe publisher is most grateful to the city staff for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.\nCopyright\nAll editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Municipal Code Corporation and the City of Brookings, South Dakota.

Additions for clarity are indicated by brackets.\n\nThe City shall have all powers possible for a city to have under the Constitutions of this State and of the United States. It is the intention of this Charter to confer upon the City every power it may have under law, as fully and completely as though the power was specifically mentioned.\n\nThis Charter shall be construed liberally in favor of the City and the specific mention of particular municipal powers in other sections of this Charter does not limit the powers of the City to those so mentioned.\n\nThe City may exercise any of its powers or perform any of its functions and may participate in the financing thereof, jointly or in cooperation, by contract or otherwise, with any one (1) or more states or any state division or agency, or the United States or any of its agencies or any township, county or municipality.\nThe City retains and reserves its right to Joint Exercise of Governmental Powers as set forth in SDCL Title 1.

The general codification shall be adopted by the Council by ordinance and shall be published promptly in bound or loose-leaf form, together with this Charter and any amendments thereto, pertinent provisions of the Constitution and other laws of the State of South Dakota, and such codes of technical regulations and other rules and regulations as the Council may specify. This compilation shall be known and cited officially as the Brookings City Code of Ordinances. Copies of the Code shall be furnished to City officers, placed in libraries and public offices for free public reference and made available for purchase by the public at a reasonable price fixed by the Council.

The City Manager may request and shall be afforded a public hearing, and the City Council shall set a time for a public hearing upon the question of the City Manager's removal. After the public hearing, if one is requested, the City Council by the affirmative vote of four (4) of its total membership may adopt a final resolution of removal. The City Manager shall continue to receive full salary until the effective date of a final resolution of removal.\n\nBy letter filed with the City Clerk, the City Manager shall designate a City officer or employee to exercise the powers and perform the duties of City Manager during the manager's temporary absence or disability. The City Council may revoke such designation at any time and appoint another officer of the City to serve until the City Manager returns.\n\nThe City Manager shall be the chief administrative officer of the City, responsible to the Council for the administration of all city matters placed in the manager's charge by or under this Charter.

It is the policy of the city, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, to provide reasonable accommodations in the application of its ordinances for disabled persons who are seeking fair and equal access to housing in the city. The purpose of this section is to establish a process for making and acting upon requests for reasonable accommodations.\n(b)\nDefinitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms will have the meanings provided below:\na.\nReasonable accommodation. A \"reasonable accommodation\" is the provision to a disabled individual (or to a provider or developer of housing for disabled individuals) of flexibility in the application of land-use and zoning regulations or policies, including via the modification or waiver of certain requirements, if such modification or waiver is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.\nb.\nDisability or disabled. An individual is \"disabled\" or suffers from a \"disability\" if he or she would qualify under the definitions of those terms in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and its implementing regulations.\n(c)\nRequest for accommodation. A disabled individual, the representative of a disabled individual, or a developer or provider of housing for disabled individuals may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of a city ordinance using an application form provided by the city. Such application form will be publicly available on the city's website and at the office of the city's community development department. The application will include a detailed explanation of why the modification is reasonably necessary to make the specific housing available to the person, including: (i) information establishing that the applicant (or, as applicable, the individual on whose behalf the applicant is requesting accommodation) is disabled; (ii) information demonstrating the burden the existing city ordinance places on efforts to accommodate the disabled individual; (iii) information outlining in detail the terms of the requested accommodation, and (iv) if the application is submitted on behalf of a group of disabled individuals, the number of individuals to be housed and why that number is necessary to accommodate each individual. If a project for which the request is being made also requires an additional land-use review or approval, the applicant must file the request concurrently with the land-use review. The application may be accompanied by any other documentary evidence that the applicant reasonably believes may be pertinent to evaluating the applicant's requested accommodation. A completed application must be submitted to the Community Development Department, who in turn will promptly transmit the application and any accompanying materials to the city council.\n(d)\nHearing before city council.\na.\nUpon city council's receipt of an application for accommodation, the application will be scheduled for a hearing at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting that is at least 15 days from the date of the council's receipt of the request for accommodation.\nb.\nNotice of the hearing at which the city council will evaluate the request will be mailed at least ten days before the meeting at which such hearing will be held to the owners of all properties located within 250 feet of the property subject to the request.\nc.\nAt the hearing, the city council will evaluate the request according to the following factors: (i) whether the applicant or the individuals whom the applicant represents are disabled; (ii) whether the request is needed to allow the disabled individual equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling or to live in a particular neighborhood as an individual without disabilities; (iii) whether the request is reasonable, considering the potential impact on surrounding uses, the extent to which the requested accommodation meets the stated need, and other alternatives that may meet that need; (iv) whether the request would fundamentally alter the city's zoning scheme; (v) whether the request would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and (vi) any other factors that may have bearing on the request, as determined by the city. At the conclusion of this hearing, the city council will grant or deny the request.\nd.\nIn the course of evaluating the petition at the hearing, the city council may consider, in addition to the application and the materials submitted alongside it, any additional documentary evidence presented by the applicant and the oral or written testimony of the applicant and of any other interested persons. At all times, the applicant has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it is entitled to the accommodation.\n(e)\nNature of approval. An approved request is granted only to the applicant and does not run with the land unless the city determines: (i) that the accommodation would be physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered or (ii) that the accommodation is to be used by another individual with a disability. The city council must make this finding on the record during the meeting at which the request is approved.\n(f)\nAmendments. Proposed amendments to any reasonable accommodation provided by the city must be presented and processed in the same manner as an original request.\n(Ord.

It is the policy of the city, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, to provide reasonable accommodations in the application of its ordinances for disabled persons who are seeking fair and equal access to housing in the city. The purpose of this section is to establish a process for making and acting upon requests for reasonable accommodations.\n(b)\nDefinitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms will have the meanings provided below:\na.\nReasonable accommodation. A \"reasonable accommodation\" is the provision to a disabled individual (or to a provider or developer of housing for disabled individuals) of flexibility in the application of land-use and zoning regulations or policies, including via the modification or waiver of certain requirements, if such modification or waiver is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.\nb.\nDisability or disabled. An individual is \"disabled\" or suffers from a \"disability\" if he or she would qualify under the definitions of those terms in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and its implementing regulations.\n(c)\nRequest for accommodation. A disabled individual, the representative of a disabled individual, or a developer or provider of housing for disabled individuals may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of a city ordinance using an application form provided by the city. Such application form will be publicly available on the city's website and at the office of the city's community development department. The application will include a detailed explanation of why the modification is reasonably necessary to make the specific housing available to the person, including: (i) information establishing that the applicant (or, as applicable, the individual on whose behalf the applicant is requesting accommodation) is disabled; (ii) information demonstrating the burden the existing city ordinance places on efforts to accommodate the disabled individual; (iii) information outlining in detail the terms of the requested accommodation, and (iv) if the application is submitted on behalf of a group of disabled individuals, the number of individuals to be housed and why that number is necessary to accommodate each individual. If a project for which the request is being made also requires an additional land-use review or approval, the applicant must file the request concurrently with the land-use review. The application may be accompanied by any other documentary evidence that the applicant reasonably believes may be pertinent to evaluating the applicant's requested accommodation. A completed application must be submitted to the Community Development Department, who in turn will promptly transmit the application and any accompanying materials to the city council.\n(d)\nHearing before city council.\na.\nUpon city council's receipt of an application for accommodation, the application will be scheduled for a hearing at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting that is at least 15 days from the date of the council's receipt of the request for accommodation.\nb.\nNotice of the hearing at which the city council will evaluate the request will be mailed at least ten days before the meeting at which such hearing will be held to the owners of all properties located within 250 feet of the property subject to the request.\nc.\nAt the hearing, the city council will evaluate the request according to the following factors: (i) whether the applicant or the individuals whom the applicant represents are disabled; (ii) whether the request is needed to allow the disabled individual equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling or to live in a particular neighborhood as an individual without disabilities; (iii) whether the request is reasonable, considering the potential impact on surrounding uses, the extent to which the requested accommodation meets the stated need, and other alternatives that may meet that need; (iv) whether the request would fundamentally alter the city's zoning scheme; (v) whether the request would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and (vi) any other factors that may have bearing on the request, as determined by the city. At the conclusion of this hearing, the city council will grant or deny the request.\nd.\nIn the course of evaluating the petition at the hearing, the city council may consider, in addition to the application and the materials submitted alongside it, any additional documentary evidence presented by the applicant and the oral or written testimony of the applicant and of any other interested persons. At all times, the applicant has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it is entitled to the accommodation.\n(e)\nNature of approval. An approved request is granted only to the applicant and does not run with the land unless the city determines: (i) that the accommodation would be physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered or (ii) that the accommodation is to be used by another individual with a disability. The city council must make this finding on the record during the meeting at which the request is approved.\n(f)\nAmendments. Proposed amendments to any reasonable accommodation provided by the city must be presented and processed in the same manner as an original request.\n(Ord.

It is the policy of the city, pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988, to provide reasonable accommodations in the application of its ordinances for disabled persons who are seeking fair and equal access to housing in the city. The purpose of this section is to establish a process for making and acting upon requests for reasonable accommodations.\n(b)\nDefinitions. For purposes of this section, the following terms will have the meanings provided below:\na.\nReasonable accommodation. A \"reasonable accommodation\" is the provision to a disabled individual (or to a provider or developer of housing for disabled individuals) of flexibility in the application of land-use and zoning regulations or policies, including via the modification or waiver of certain requirements, if such modification or waiver is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities.\nb.\nDisability or disabled. An individual is \"disabled\" or suffers from a \"disability\" if he or she would qualify under the definitions of those terms in the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and its implementing regulations.\n(c)\nRequest for accommodation. A disabled individual, the representative of a disabled individual, or a developer or provider of housing for disabled individuals may request a reasonable accommodation in the application of a city ordinance using an application form provided by the city. Such application form will be publicly available on the city's website and at the office of the city's community development department. The application will include a detailed explanation of why the modification is reasonably necessary to make the specific housing available to the person, including: (i) information establishing that the applicant (or, as applicable, the individual on whose behalf the applicant is requesting accommodation) is disabled; (ii) information demonstrating the burden the existing city ordinance places on efforts to accommodate the disabled individual; (iii) information outlining in detail the terms of the requested accommodation, and (iv) if the application is submitted on behalf of a group of disabled individuals, the number of individuals to be housed and why that number is necessary to accommodate each individual. If a project for which the request is being made also requires an additional land-use review or approval, the applicant must file the request concurrently with the land-use review. The application may be accompanied by any other documentary evidence that the applicant reasonably believes may be pertinent to evaluating the applicant's requested accommodation. A completed application must be submitted to the Community Development Department, who in turn will promptly transmit the application and any accompanying materials to the city council.\n(d)\nHearing before city council.\na.\nUpon city council's receipt of an application for accommodation, the application will be scheduled for a hearing at the next regularly scheduled city council meeting that is at least 15 days from the date of the council's receipt of the request for accommodation.\nb.\nNotice of the hearing at which the city council will evaluate the request will be mailed at least ten days before the meeting at which such hearing will be held to the owners of all properties located within 250 feet of the property subject to the request.\nc.\nAt the hearing, the city council will evaluate the request according to the following factors: (i) whether the applicant or the individuals whom the applicant represents are disabled; (ii) whether the request is needed to allow the disabled individual equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling or to live in a particular neighborhood as an individual without disabilities; (iii) whether the request is reasonable, considering the potential impact on surrounding uses, the extent to which the requested accommodation meets the stated need, and other alternatives that may meet that need; (iv) whether the request would fundamentally alter the city's zoning scheme; (v) whether the request would impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the city; and (vi) any other factors that may have bearing on the request, as determined by the city. At the conclusion of this hearing, the city council will grant or deny the request.\nd.\nIn the course of evaluating the petition at the hearing, the city council may consider, in addition to the application and the materials submitted alongside it, any additional documentary evidence presented by the applicant and the oral or written testimony of the applicant and of any other interested persons. At all times, the applicant has the burden to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that it is entitled to the accommodation.\n(e)\nNature of approval. An approved request is granted only to the applicant and does not run with the land unless the city determines: (i) that the accommodation would be physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered or (ii) that the accommodation is to be used by another individual with a disability. The city council must make this finding on the record during the meeting at which the request is approved.\n(f)\nAmendments. Proposed amendments to any reasonable accommodation provided by the city must be presented and processed in the same manner as an original request.\n(Ord.

Any restaurant that only serves fry orders or food such as sandwiches, hamburgers or salads is not a full-service restaurant;\nRestaurant, any area in a building which is maintained, advertised and held out to the public as a place where individually priced meals are prepared and served primarily for consumption in such area and where not more than 40 percent of the gross revenue of the restaurant is derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages. The restaurant shall have a dining room or rooms, a kitchen and the number and kinds of employees necessary for the preparing, cooking and serving of meals.\n(b)\nLicense application requirements:\nDocumentation: An applicant for a full-service restaurant on-sale license shall provide sufficient documentation to the municipality with an application form provided by the municipality to prove that the primary source of revenue from the operation of the restaurant will be derived from the sale of prepared food and nonalcoholic beverages and not from the sale of alcoholic beverages.

However, any fair market value so established shall be a minimum of $1.00 for each person residing within the city as measured by the last preceding decennial federal census.\n(2)\nThe license fee shall be initially established by resolution within 90 days of the initial adoption of this section. Subsequent changes in the license fee shall not be made for a period of ten years from the effective date of adoption of this section unless a population growth reported by the federal decennial census requires an increase in the fee.\n(3)\nFair market value for full-service restaurant license shall be established as follows:\na.\nWithin 90 days of the effective date of this article and as required by state statute, each licensee within the city who owns an on-sale license issued pursuant to SDCL 35-4-2 (4) or (6) as of January 1, 2008, and who purchased the license or had the license transferred to such licensee at anytime between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2008, shall report the amount originally paid for the on-sale license to the city manager on forms provided by the city. Any form submitted pursuant to this provision shall be signed under oath and shall include the documents establishing the amount originally paid for the on-sale license. If the transaction for the purchase of the on-sale license included real or personal property, the full market value of the real or personal property on the date of the original sale shall be deducted from the total transaction price to determine the amount paid by the licensee for the on-sale license. The burden of establishing the amount paid for the license shall be on the licensee.

Any restaurant that only serves fry orders or food such as sandwiches, hamburgers or salads is not a full-service restaurant;\nRestaurant, any area in a building which is maintained, advertised and held out to the public as a place where individually priced meals are prepared and served primarily for consumption in such area and where not more than 40 percent of the gross revenue of the restaurant is derived from the sale of alcoholic beverages. The restaurant shall have a dining room or rooms, a kitchen and the number and kinds of employees necessary for the preparing, cooking and serving of meals.\n(b)\nLicense application requirements:\nDocumentation: An applicant for a full-service restaurant on-sale license shall provide sufficient documentation to the municipality with an application form provided by the municipality to prove that the primary source of revenue from the operation of the restaurant will be derived from the sale of prepared food and nonalcoholic beverages and not from the sale of alcoholic beverages. The supporting documentation concerning the primary source of revenue submitted pursuant to this section is confidential.\n(c)\nAnnual reports: The full-service restaurant on-sale licensee shall submit an annual report and supporting documentation to the city on forms provided by the city of the annual sales of the full-service restaurant, which includes an oath verifying the validity of the information provided in the report.

However, any fair market value so established shall be a minimum of $1.00 for each person residing within the city as measured by the last preceding decennial federal census.\n(2)\nThe license fee shall be initially established by resolution within 90 days of the initial adoption of this section. Subsequent changes in the license fee shall not be made for a period of ten years from the effective date of adoption of this section unless a population growth reported by the federal decennial census requires an increase in the fee.\n(3)\nFair market value for full-service restaurant license shall be established as follows:\na.\nWithin 90 days of the effective date of this article and as required by state statute, each licensee within the city who owns an on-sale license issued pursuant to SDCL 35-4-2 (4) or (6) as of January 1, 2008, and who purchased the license or had the license transferred to such licensee at anytime between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2008, shall report the amount originally paid for the on-sale license to the city manager on forms provided by the city. Any form submitted pursuant to this provision shall be signed under oath and shall include the documents establishing the amount originally paid for the on-sale license. If the transaction for the purchase of the on-sale license included real or personal property, the full market value of the real or personal property on the date of the original sale shall be deducted from the total transaction price to determine the amount paid by the licensee for the on-sale license. The burden of establishing the amount paid for the license shall be on the licensee. Any licensee contesting the fair market value of the real or personal property may appeal the valuation adopted by the city to circuit court.\nb.\nFor purposes of this section, the term \"current fair market value\" means the documented price of the on-sale license most recently sold between January 1, 2003, and January 1, 2008, through an arm's length transaction, less the value of any real or personal property included within the transaction.\nc.\nIn the event it is determined that under SDCL Chapter 35-4, no on-sale license has been purchased or transferred because such licenses are not transferable in a local option community, but may only be subject to an operating agreement, then the license fee shall nonetheless be set at or above the minimum of $1.00 for each person residing within the city as measured by the last preceding decennial federal census.\n(h)\nRegistry of full-service restaurant on-sale licensees: The city shall maintain a registry of each full-service on-sale restaurant license that is being offered for sale and the city shall furnish a copy of the registry to anyone who requests a new-full service restaurant on-sale license. The existing full-service restaurant on-sale licensee is responsible for registering with the city that the full-service restaurant on-sale license is for sale.\n(i)\nIssuance of new full-service restaurant licenses restricted: The city may only issue a new license pursuant to this section if no on-sale license is on the registry or a person desiring to purchase an on-sale license listed on the registry provides documentation showing that the person is unable to purchase the on-sale license at the price established in subsection (g) of this article and on terms satisfactory to both the potential buyer and seller.

In reaching a decision concerning whether extreme hardship exists, the BHPC or the local historic district commission shall evaluate the information the applicant submits, including some or all of the following: the current occupants of the building and their ability to make reasonable use of it, its present condition and cost of operation each year, the cost of any repairs that are needed, the present income from the building and the projected income from the building after repairs.\nHistoric easement. Any easement, restriction, covenant or condition running with the land, designated to preserve, maintain or enhance all or part of the existing state of places of historical, architectural, archaeological or cultural significance.\nHistoric preservation.

The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property must be avoided.\n(3)\nEach property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings shall not be undertaken.\n(4)\nMost properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.\n(5)\nDistinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.\n(6)\nDeteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where the severity of deterioration requires replacement of a distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities, and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.\n(7)\nChemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting that cause damage to historic materials must not be used.

No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.03.020, 8-26-2003)\n\n(a)\n[Approval process.] All proposed subdivision plats must be approved by the city through a three-phase development process. When there are only a small number of lots being platted, the requirements for a sketch plan and preliminary plat may be waived by the city.\n(1)\nSketch plan: Prior to the submission of the preliminary plat to the planning commission, the developer shall present a sketch of the proposed plan to the community development department for discussion and comments regarding the requirements for the general layout of streets/roads, street improvements, parks, trails, and open spaces, sewerage, availability of services and similar matters. A sketch storm drainage study as required by the Storm Drainage Design and Technical Criteria Manual shall also be submitted at the time the sketch plan is submitted.\n(2)\nPreliminary plat: Based on the discussion of the sketch plan and sketch storm drainage study, the applicant may submit the preliminary plat for approval. The preliminary plat shall provide all of the information indicated in article III. The plat will be subject to the review and approval by the planning commission prior to approval by the city council. Either all or a portion of the preliminary plat may be final platted.\n(3)\nFinal plat: The final plat shall consist of the final layout of all lots and blocks, rights-of-way and include all easements and as required by the city. A final utility plan, a final storm drainage study and plan as required by the Storm Drainage Design and Technical Criteria Manual, grading plan, and a groundwater control plan may also be required.\na.\nThe final grading and drainage plan and the groundwater control plan shall be approved or disapproved within 15 days after submittal to the city. The final utility plan shall be similarly approved or disapproved by the Brookings Municipal Utilities Department. If approved, the developer may then submit the plat for approval.\nb.\nThe plat shall provide the information indicated in the subdivision improvements and design standards for final plats and shall require the review and recommendation of the community development director and city engineer. The plat shall be in conformance with an approved preliminary plat if a preliminary plat is required.\nc.\nThe storm water drainage study, when required, shall be in accordance with the Storm Drainage Design and Technical Criteria Manual.\n(b)\nReplats. If the land proposed for platting is a resubdivision, it shall require a preliminary plat and a final plat of the resubdivision, requiring the same review and approval procedures as the preliminary plat and the final plat, unless the resubdivision meets the requirements set forth in article V, below. The community development director may waive the requirements for a preliminary plat.\n(c)\nFiling fee. A filing fee shall be deposited at the community development department for all preliminary plats, final plats and for all replats. Reasonable fees sufficient to cover the costs of administration, and similar matters shall be charged to applicants for the preliminary plat and final plat approval. The amount of fees charged shall be set forth by resolution of the city council. Fees established in accordance with this section shall be paid upon submission of a signed application.\n(Ord. No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.03.030, 8-26-2003; Ord. No. 11-06, \u00a7 I(51.03.030), 6-13-2006; Ord. No. 20-009, \u00a7 I, 6-9-2020)\n\nWhenever a preliminary plat is proposed, the developer shall submit one copy at an appropriate engineering scale but in no case greater than a scale of 200 feet to one inch. The preliminary plat shall be submitted to the community development department on or before the first day of the month in order for the preliminary plat to be considered at the following month's planning commission meeting (e.g., file by August 1 for consideration at the September planning commission meeting). The preliminary plat shall contain the following:\n(a)\nPreliminary subdivision plat.\n1.\nThe proposed name of the subdivision. The name shall not duplicate, be the same in spelling or alike in pronunciation with the name of any other recorded subdivision, unless it is an extension of or adjoining an existing subdivision.\n2.\nThe names of all adjoining subdivisions and all lot and block lines, easements and rights-of-way. Adjoining unplatted property shall be labeled as such.\n3.\nThe owner, developer and surveyor's names, addresses and telephone numbers.\n4.\nThe correct legal description, notations stating acreage, scale and north arrow.\n5.\nA systematic lot and block numbering pattern, lot lines and street/road names.\n6.\nThe location and width of proposed and existing streets/roads, alleys, easements, parks, railroad rights-of-way and other significant features.\n7.\nBoundary lines of floodways and special flood hazard areas delineated on the flood insurance rate maps (FIRM).\n8.\nExisting contours referenced to city datum with intervals sufficient to determine the character and topography of the land to be subdivided.\n(b)\nOther preliminary plans. When required by the appropriate public agency, the following plans shall be submitted in conjunction with the preliminary plat:\n1.\nGrading plan. The grading plan shall show the existing contours with intervals acceptable to the city engineer's office. Any proposed cut and fill operations must also be shown if they will substantially alter existing land elevations.\n2.\nDrainage plan. A preliminary storm drainage study as required by the Storm Drainage Design and Technical Criteria Manual shall be submitted for preliminary approval. The plan shall also indicate which downstream drainageways or detention basins will be affected by the full development of the subdivision.\n3.\nGroundwater control plan. Groundwater elevations shall be required where it is deemed necessary by the city to establish a finished grade for the proper development of the subdivision. When elevations are required, the method of groundwater collection shall be indicated for all lots prior to development. Dewatering for the purposes of establishing a lower finished grade shall be prohibited. Buildings with crawl spaces or slab on grade construction shall be exempt from groundwater collection requirements.\n4.\nUtility plan. The utility plan shall show all sanitary sewer locations, size, flow direction, approximate manhole locations and invert elevations, lift stations and connection to the existing system. The water main layout shall show the pipe location and size, hydrant and valve location and connection to the existing system.\n(Ord. No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.04.010, 8-26-2003; Ord. No. 11-06, \u00a7 I(51.04.010), 6-13-2006; Ord. No. 20-021, \u00a7 I, 10-13-2020)\n\nAfter the preliminary plat has been recommended for approval or disapproval by the planning commission, it shall be submitted to the city council for its approval or disapproval. The approved preliminary plat shall be kept on file in the community development department. Approval of the preliminary plat shall indicate approval of the development concept only, and it does not constitute an acceptance or approval of the subdivision plan. Therefore, no building permits shall be issued based on the approval of the preliminary plat.\n(Ord. No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.04.020, 8-26-2003)\n\nThe approval of a preliminary plat shall be effective for a period of three years, at the end of which time approval of the subdivision plat or a portion thereof must have been obtained from the city. Any preliminary plat which has not received approval for all or a portion of it within the period of time set forth herein may be declared void and the applicant may be required to resubmit a new preliminary plat for review and approval subject to any new subdivision regulations.\n(Ord. No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.04.030, 8-26-2003)\n\nAmendments to an approved preliminary plat may be submitted at any time by the developer. Minor changes such as street or subdivision names, lot lines, easements, drainage or lot and block number may be approved by the community development director. Major changes such as a change in the street layout, open space or parkland dedication, number of lots or perimeter boundaries shall follow the procedures for approval of a preliminary plat as required in this section.\n(Ord. No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.04.040, 8-26-2003)\n\nNo plat shall be recorded in the office of the register of deeds and no lots shall be sold from such plat unless and until approved as herein provided. No document of any sale or transfer of unplatted property shall be recorded except in accordance with this chapter.\n(Ord. No. 22-03, \u00a7 51.05.000, 8-26-2003)\n\nOne electronic copy and one reproducible mylar of the plat with signatures shall be submitted to the community development department. An electronic CAD file version of the plat line work, produced in accordance with the city engineering standards, shall also accompany the plat submission. The CAD line work must match signed hard copy. The plat shall be drawn at a scale of 100 feet to one inch, or at an appropriate scale as determined by the licensed land surveyor, from an accurate survey and on one or more sheets whose dimensions are as required by state law. If more than two sheets are required, an index sheet of the same dimension shall be attached and filed. The plat shall show the following information:\n(a)\nThe proposed name of the subdivision.

In granting such variances, the planning commission may require the conditions it determines are necessary to satisfy the basic objectives of the particular regulations. Any variance granted by the planning commission shall be noted in its official minutes.\n(a)\nHardship. Where the planning commission finds that extraordinary hardships or particular difficulties may result from strict compliance with these regulations, it may, after written application by the developer, grant variances to the regulations subject to specified conditions so that substantial justice may be done and the public interest secured. Such variances shall not have the effect of nullifying the intent and purpose of these regulations or the comprehensive plan. The planning commission shall not grant variances to these regulations unless they make findings based upon evidence presented to them in each specific case that:\n1.\nBecause of unusual surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property, a particular hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were adhered to.\n2.\nThe conditions upon which the request for a variance is based are unique to the property and are not applicable, generally, to other property and have not been created by any person having an interest in the property.\n3.\nThe purpose of the variance is not based exclusively upon a desire for financial gain.\n4.\nThe granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public's health, safety or welfare or injurious to property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the property is located.\n(b)\nLarge scale residential developments. The standards and requirements of these regulations may be modified by the planning commission in the case of a plan for a new residential neighborhood which, in the judgment of the planning commission, complies with the objectives of the comprehensive plan and section 94-341 of the zoning ordinance.\n(c)\nDesign innovations. From time to time subdivisions may be designed to provide unusual amenities and at the same time fail to conform strictly to the provisions of these regulations. The planning commission may waive certain requirements of these regulations in approving subdivisions involving detailed and workable design innovations that would yield an enhanced living environment for future occupants.\n(Ord.

The city council does find that there exists and has existed an increasing trend towards the display of adult reading material at grocery stores, convenience stores, drugstores and other retail outlets within the city. Such adult reading material is often displayed within the open view of minors and is easily accessible to them.

No. 3-99, \u00a7 3-6, 1-26-1999)\n\nThe city council is enacting this ordinance to help prevent the spread of graffiti vandalism and to establish a program for the removal of graffiti from public and private property. The city council is authorized to adopt this ordinance pursuant to its police powers, which authorize the city, under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti from private and public property.\nThe city council finds that graffiti is a public nuisance and is destructive to the rights and values of property owners as well as the entire community. Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods may be affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city.\nThe city council intends, through the adoption of this ordinance, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement.\n(Ord. No. 27-08, \u00a7 I, 5-27-2008)\n\nGraffiti means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, painting or other defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched, sprayed, drawn, painted, or engraved on or otherwise affixed to any surface of public or private property by any graffiti implement, to the extent that the graffiti was not authorized in advance by the owner or occupant of the property, or, despite advance authorization, is otherwise deemed a public nuisance by the city council.\n(Ord. No. 27-08, \u00a7 I, 5-27-2008)\n\nDefacement. It is unlawful for any person to apply graffiti to any natural or manmade surface on any city-owned property or, without the permission of the owner or occupant, on any non-city owned property.\n\n(a)\nThe existence of graffiti on public or private property in violation of this article is expressly declared to be a public nuisance and, therefore, is subject to the removal and abatement provisions specified in this article as well as any other law which permits abatement of a public nuisance.\n(b)\nIt is the duty of both the owner of the property to which the graffiti has been applied and any person who may be in possession or who has the right to possess such property to at all times keep the property clear of graffiti.\n(Ord. No. 27-08, \u00a7 I, 5-27-2008)\n\nAny person applying graffiti on public or private property shall have the duty to remove the graffiti within 24 hours after notice by the city or private owner of the property involved. Such removal shall be done in a manner prescribed by the chief of police, or the designee of the chief of police or other city official. Any person applying graffiti shall be responsible for the removal or for the payment for the removal of the graffiti. Failure of any person to remove graffiti or pay for the removal shall constitute an additional violation of this article. Where graffiti is applied by an unemancipated minor, the parents or legal guardian shall also be responsible for such removal or for the payment for the removal of the graffiti.\n(Ord. No. 27-08, \u00a7 I, 5-27-2008)\n\nIf graffiti is not removed by the perpetrator according to section 58-244, graffiti will be removed pursuant to the following provisions:\n(1)\nProperty owner responsibility. It is unlawful for any person who is the owner or who has primary responsibility for control of property or for repair or maintenance of property in the city to permit property that is defaced with graffiti to remain defaced for a period of ten days after service by the city of notice of the defacement. The notice shall contain the following information:\na.\nThe street address or legal description of the property sufficient for identification of the property;\nb.\nA statement that the property is a potential graffiti nuisance property with a concise description of the conditions leading to the finding;\nc.\nA statement that the graffiti must be removed within ten days after receipt of the notice and that if the graffiti is not abated within that time the city may declare the property to be a public nuisance, subject to nuisance abatement; and\nd.\nAn information sheet identifying any graffiti removal assistance programs available through the city and private graffiti removal contractors.\n(2)\nExceptions to property owner responsibility. The removal requirements of subsection (1) above shall not apply if the property owner or responsible party can demonstrate that:\na.\nThe property owner or responsible party lacks the financial ability to remove the defacing graffiti; or\nb.\nThe property owner or responsible party has an active program for the removal of graffiti and has scheduled the removal of the graffiti as part of that program, in which case it shall be unlawful to permit such property to remain defaced with graffiti for a period of 15 days after service by the city of notice of the defacement.\n(3)\nRight of city to remove.\na.\nUse of public funds. Whenever the city becomes aware of graffiti or is notified and determines that graffiti is located on publicly or privately owned property viewable from a public place, the city shall be authorized to use public funds for the removal of the graffiti, or for the painting or repairing of the article affected by the graffiti, but shall not authorize or undertake to provide for the painting or repair of any more extensive an area than that where the graffiti is located, unless the city manager or designee determines in writing that a more extensive area is required to be repainted or repaired in order to avoid an aesthetic disfigurement to the area or neighborhood, or unless the property owner or responsible party agrees to pay for the costs of repainting or repairing the more extensive area.\nb.\nRight of entry on private property. Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner or responsible party and to obtain a release of the city from liability for property damage. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this ordinance, or if the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent with the terms of this section, the city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to state law or city ordinances which provide further abatement procedures for public nuisances.\n(Ord.

Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods may be affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city.\nThe city council intends, through the adoption of this ordinance, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement.\n(Ord.

Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner or responsible party and to obtain a release of the city from liability for property damage. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this ordinance, or if the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent with the terms of this section, the city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to state law or city ordinances which provide further abatement procedures for public nuisances.\n(Ord.

Unless the city acts to remove graffiti from public and private property, the graffiti tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti, and entire neighborhoods may be affected and become less desirable places in which to be, all to the detriment of the city.\nThe city council intends, through the adoption of this ordinance, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect public and private property from acts of graffiti vandalism and defacement.\n(Ord.

Prior to entering upon private property or property owned by a public entity other than the city for the purpose of graffiti removal, the city shall attempt to secure the consent of the property owner or responsible party and to obtain a release of the city from liability for property damage. If the property owner or responsible party fails to remove the offending graffiti within the time specified by this ordinance, or if the city has requested consent to remove or paint over the offending graffiti and the property owner or responsible party has refused consent for entry on terms acceptable to the city and consistent with the terms of this section, the city may commence abatement and cost recovery proceedings for the graffiti removal according to state law or city ordinances which provide further abatement procedures for public nuisances.\n(Ord.

No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nThe city may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nAny person discharging to the MS4 in violation of this chapter may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The city will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the city for a reconsideration and hearing.\nA person commits a violation of this ordinance if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this article without the prior approval of the city.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nAny person subject to an industrial or construction activity NPDES stormwater discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit.

The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy.\n(4)\nUnreasonable delays in allowing the city access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this chapter. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the authorized enforcement agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this chapter.\n(5)\nIf the city has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged where there is probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this chapter, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this chapter or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the city, then the city or authorized enforcement agency may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nThe city requires best management practices (BMP's) for any activity, operation or facility which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the United States. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal storm drain system or watercourses through the use of these structural and nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMP's to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, may constitute compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMP's shall be part of a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nEvery person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee or tenant, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse located within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation and other obstacles that may pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function or physical integrity of the watercourse.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nIn addition to other reporting requirements which may be required by applicable law, as soon as any person responsible for property or a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illicit discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the storm drain system or waters of the U.S., the responsible person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials, the responsible person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, the responsible person shall notify the authorized enforcement agency in person or by phone no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the city within three business days of the verbal notice. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three years.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nWhenever the city or state or federal authorized enforcement agency finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible person. Such notice may require without limitation:\n(1)\nThe performance of monitoring, analyses and reporting;\n(2)\nThe elimination of illicit connections or discharges;\n(3)\nThat violating discharges, practices or operations shall cease and desist;\n(4)\nThe abatement or remediation of stormwater pollution or contamination hazards and the restoration of any affected property;\n(5)\nPayment of a fine to cover administrative and remediation costs; and\n(6)\nThe implementation of source control or treatment BMPs.\nIf abatement of a violation and/or restoration of affected property is required, the notice shall set forth a deadline within which such remediation or restoration must be completed. Said notice shall further advise that should the violator fail to remediate or restore the affected property by the established deadline, the work will be done by a designated governmental agency or a contractor and the expense thereof shall be charged to the violator.\nIn lieu of enforcement proceedings, penalties and remedies authorized by this chapter, the authorized enforcement agency may impose upon a violator alternative compensatory actions, such as storm drain stenciling, attendance at compliance workshops, creek cleanup, etc.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nAny person receiving a notice of violation from the city may appeal the determination. The notice of appeal must be received within five days from the date of the notice of violation. A hearing of the appeal will be held by the city manager or designee, and shall take place within 15 days from the date of receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the city manager or designee shall be final.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nWithin ten days after abatement of the violation, the owner of the property will be notified of the cost of abatement, including administrative costs. The property owner may file a written protest objecting to the amount of the assessment within five days. If the amount due is not paid within a timely manner as determined by the decision of the city or by the expiration of the time in which to file an appeal, the charges shall become a special assessment against the property and shall constitute a lien on the property for the amount of the assessment. Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is liable to the city for the cost of abatement as a result of such violation.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nIt is unlawful for any person to violate any provision of this chapter or to fail to comply with any of its requirements. If a person violates or continues to violate the provisions of this chapter, the city may petition for abatement and for a preliminary and permanent injunction restraining the person from activities which would create further violations or to compel the person to perform abatement or remediation of the violation.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nThe remedies listed in this chapter are not exclusive of any other remedies available under any applicable federal, state or local law, and it is within the discretion of the city or any other authorized enforcement agency to seek other or cumulative remedies.\n(Ord.

Additional BMP guidance can be found at www.epa.gov.\n(5)\nBe accompanied by a drainage plan if required by the city engineer. The drainage plan shall conform to the city-approved Storm Drainage Design and Technical Criteria Manual. All drainage facilities including storm sewers, on-site detention, drainageways, detention basins and detention channels shall be designed and in compliance with the Storm Drainage Design and Technical Criteria Manual and are also subject to the approval of the city engineer.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nThe city engineer or designee will review each grading permit application and accompanying stormwater plan to determine its conformance with the provisions of this ordinance.\nWithin ten business days after receiving an application, the city engineer will, in writing, either:\n(1)\nApprove the permit application; or\n(2)\nApprove the permit application subject to such reasonable conditions as may be necessary to secure substantially the objectives of this regulation, and issue the permit subject to these conditions; or\n(3)\nDisapprove the permit application, indicating the reason(s) and procedure for submitting a revised application and/or submission.\nFailure of the city engineer to act on an original or revised application within ten business days of receipt shall constitute authorization for the applicant to proceed in accordance with the plans as filed, unless additional time for the city engineer's review of the application is extended by agreement between the applicant and the city engineer.\nCity approval of a grading permit application and stormwater plan does not relieve the applicant of any responsibility for the effectiveness of the applicant's stormwater plan.\n(Ord. No. 21-10, 6-8-2010)\n\nIt is the goal of the city to encourage and assist landowners so that landowners obtain the proper permitting of land disturbance activities without the need to levy penalties. If the owner of property upon which land disturbance activities have commenced fails to obtain a grading permit pursuant to section 72-61 of this chapter, the city may issue a written notice to obtain the grading permit to the landowner and/or contractor performing the land disturbance activity. Additionally, the city will make reasonable attempts to contact the landowner, including by telephone, fax, e-mail, and/or site visits. The landowner or a responsible party shall, within ten business days of the date of the written notice of violation, obtain a grading permit from the city engineer's office. Failure to obtain a grading permit shall constitute a violation of this chapter and be subject to injunctive relief and penalties as follows:\n(1)\nWithin ten business days of the notice of violation: No penalty.\n(2)\nAfter ten business days of the notice of violation: $100.00 penalty per day, beginning with the eleventh day after the notice of violation.\n(3)\nAfter 20 business days of the notice of violation: The city will notify the South Dakota DENR of the violation.

    "text": "____________\nPublished in 2022 by Order of the City Council\n____________\nCURRENT OFFICIALS\nof the\nCITY OF\nSELBY, SOUTH DAKOTA\nAT THE TIME OF THIS REPUBLICATION\n____________\nJames Kihne\nMayor\n____________\nCasey Eisemann\nDon Knecht\nJosh Wudel\nDoug Frank\nClint Perman\nCity Council\n____________\nVickie Schulkoski\nFinance Officer\nPREFACE\nThis Code constitutes a republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Selby, South Dakota.\nSource materials used in the preparation of the republication were the City Code, as updated through 2021. The source of each new section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is part of the 1989 Municipal Code Book. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this republication, the reader can locate any section of the Code, as updated.\nNotes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this republication.\nChapter and Section Numbering System\nThe chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of three parts separated by periods. The figure before the first period refers to the title number, the figure after the first period refers to the chapter within the title, and the figure after the second period refers to the section within the chapter. Thus, the first section of the second chapter of the first title is numbered 1.02.010. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and each chapter is identified with its title and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 1.02.010 and 1.02.020 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 1.02.015. If new material is to be added to the end of a title a new chapter may be added.\nPage Numbering System\nThe page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a title of the republication, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the title. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this republication at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:\nEXPAND\nCHARTER CHT:1\nRELATED LAWS RL:1\nSPECIAL ACTS SA:1\nCHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1\nRELATED LAWS COMPARATIVE TABLE RLCT:1\nSPECIAL ACTS COMPARATIVE TABLE SACT:1\nCODE CD1:1\nCODE APPENDIX CDA:1\nCODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1\nSTATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1\nCHARTER INDEX CHTi:1\nCODE INDEX CDi:1\n  Index or Indexes\nThe index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested.\nLooseleaf Supplements\nA special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages.\nKeeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.\nAcknowledgments\nThis republication was under the direct supervision of Cristine Dawson, Editor, and Erin Bowen, Proofreader, of Civicplus, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project.\nThe publisher is most grateful to Ms. Vickie Schulkoski, for her cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this republication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a republication of this Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the borough readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.\nCopyright\nAll editorial enhancements of this Code are copyrighted by Civicplus and the City of Selby, South Dakota. Editorial enhancements include, but are not limited to: organization; table of contents; section catchlines; (pretitle or prechapter) section analyses; editor's notes; cross references; state law references; numbering system; code comparative table; state law reference table; and index.
